## Dr. B's Definitive Preferences (Feb 4, 2026 - LATEST)

### Winning Settings (confirmed by Dr. B's top picks)
1. **Libraries** with warm mahogany bookshelves, reading lamps
2. **Parisian/European cafés** in autumn with fallen leaves
3. **Moody European streets** — rain, cobblestones, dusk, neon reflections
4. **Fireside/lodge** — cozy elegant interiors
5. **Wine bars/cellars** — candlelight, oak barrels

### Winning Outfits
- **VERY short pleated skirts** (burgundy, plaid/tartan, black) — SHORTER is better
- **Fitted tops** — crop tops, camisoles, tank tops, off-shoulder, turtlenecks (NO blazers/jackets)
- **LESS fabric on top** — show more curves, fitted/cropped preferred
- **MORE CURVES** — emphasize body shape
- **Dark tights / thigh-high stockings / thigh-high socks**
  - Stockings for upscale/nightlife settings
  - Socks for cozy/academic settings
- **Heeled boots or stilettos**

### Body Type (Feb 4, 2026 — CRITICAL)
- **FIT and ATHLETIC** — toned like she works out regularly
- **Curves on top AND bottom** — NOT just skinny, athletic hourglass
- Think: fitness model who lifts weights, not runway model
- Keywords: "athletic build", "toned", "fit physique", "athletic hourglass figure"
- She looks like she does squats, deadlifts, and upper body work

### Skin Tone
- "Light warm skin" or "fair olive complexion" — NOT "tanned" or "tan"

### Pose
- Full body, legs slightly apart, confident
- Show off legs and figure
- Emphasize athletic curves

### What NOT to do
- No blazers or jackets
- No long skirts
- No conservative/covered-up looks
- No "tanned" skin language

## Generation Notes
- Use Playground AI (Nano Banana model) - FREE
- Or Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)
- Save to `vienna-images/` folder
- Upload to GitHub gallery when complete

## Dr. B's Preferences (Feb 4, 2026) — ALWAYS FOLLOW
- **Appearance**: Tanned Caucasian woman, long dark hair, glasses
- **Default outfit**: Short tight skirt + stockings/hosiery + fitted top/blouse
- **Favorites**: Plaid/tartan skirts, pencil skirts, mini skirts
- **Pose preference**: Legs slightly apart, confident, full body shots showing legs
- **Fitness/gym exception**: Tight leggings OR tight shorts — show off upper and lower curves, enhance figure
- **Key elements**: Sheer dark hosiery, above-knee hemlines, figure-enhancing silhouettes
- **Reference**: Library scholar image — white top, plaid mini skirt, leather chair, fireplace
- **Priority**: These preferences apply to ALL future images regardless of setting

## Winning Formulas (Feb 4, 2026 - Dr. B confirmed)
### Top Settings (weight heavily)
- Libraries with warm bookshelves
- Parisian/European cafés  
- Moody European streets (rain, autumn)

### Top Outfits
- Short pleated skirts (burgundy, plaid) — SHORTER is better
- Fitted turtlenecks (black, burgundy)

- Less "beach bronze", more natural warm
