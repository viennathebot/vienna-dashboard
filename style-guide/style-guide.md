## 🌡️ Las Vegas Heat Considerations

Las Vegas spring/summer means **95–115°F**. Every piece in this guide accounts for that reality:

- **Fabrics**: Linen, cotton, chambray, moisture-wicking blends, Tencel, seersucker
- **Colors**: Lighter tones reflect heat — whites, light blues, stone, sage, soft pink
- **Construction**: Unstructured blazers (no canvas/padding), unlined pants, open-weave knits
- **Layering**: Minimal. One layer max over a shirt. Indoor A/C can be aggressive though, so a light blazer doubles as protection
- **Shoes**: Breathable loafers > closed lace-ups when possible. No-show socks always

---

## 🎨 Spring/Summer 2026 Color Palette

### Primary Neutrals
- **White** — crisp tees, dress shirts, linen pants
- **Navy** — the anchor color for everything (suits, chinos, blazers)
- **Light Grey / Heather** — versatile for tees, pants, blazers
- **Stone / Khaki** — essential for chinos and shorts
- **Charcoal** — darker option for evening events

### Accent Colors
- **Light Blue / Chambray** — shirts, polos, ties
- **Sage Green** — tees, shorts, casual button-downs
- **Dusty Rose / Muted Pink** — subtle confidence move in polos and pocket squares
- **Terracotta / Burnt Orange** — pocket squares, ties, occasional tee
- **Cream / Off-White** — summer-weight pants, knit polos

### Colors to Avoid
- Neon anything
- Loud prints or logos
- All black in 110°F (you're not going to a metal show... at least not dressed for one)

## 📐 Fit Tips for His Body Type

**6'1", 190 lbs, Athletic Build**

- **Shirts**: Slim fit or "athletic fit" — standard fit will tent at the waist; slim fit will show the build without being painted on. Brands like Bonobos and Charles Tyrwhitt offer "athletic" cuts with broader shoulders and tapered waist
- **Pants**: Slim-straight or tailored fit. Avoid skinny (too tight on quads) and relaxed (too baggy). 32–34" inseam depending on the rise
- **Blazers**: Look for structured shoulders that match your frame. Size 42R likely. Unstructured blazers in particular look great on athletic builds because they drape naturally
- **Shorts**: 7" inseam is the sweet spot — shows you don't skip leg day without being aggressive about it
- **T-shirts**: Crew neck or henley in a slim/fitted cut. The sleeves should hit mid-bicep, not flap in the wind
- **General rule**: If it fits in the shoulders, tailor the rest. A $15 tee that fits perfectly beats a $100 tee that doesn't

## 🏖️ Section 1: CASUAL (Days Off, Errands, Weekends)

### T-Shirts

#### 1. Uniqlo Supima Cotton Crew Neck T-Shirt
- **Price**: ~$15
- **Link**: [uniqlo.com](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E462666-000)
- **Colors**: White, Light Grey, Navy, Olive
- **Why**: Supima cotton is softer and more durable than regular cotton. Slim without being tight — perfect on an athletic frame. The $15 price means you can stock 5–6 colors guilt-free
- **Fit note**: Size L should work. If shoulders are broad, try XL and see if the body is too loose

#### 2. Amazon Essentials Men's Slim-Fit Short-Sleeve Crew Neck T-Shirt (2-Pack)
- **Price**: ~$16/2-pack ($8 each)
- **Link**: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BJKZ98Q)
- **Colors**: White, Heather Grey, Navy, Black
- **Why**: Budget beater for everyday basics. 100% cotton, surprisingly decent fit. Buy multiples for gym-to-errand days

- **Price**: ~$30
- **Link**: [jcrew.com](https://www.jcrew.com/c/mens/clothing/tees-and-polos)

- **Price**: ~$35
- **Link**: [bananarepublic.com](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=44873)
- **Colors**: White, Heather Grey, Navy, Olive
- **Why**: The open neckline is more interesting than a crew neck, and the buttons draw the eye upward (flattering on a taller frame). Soft jersey cotton, slim fit
- **Fit note**: True to size — go L

#### 5. Amazon Essentials Slim-Fit Long-Sleeve Henley
- **Price**: ~$14
- **Link**: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BJLFQQS)

- **Price**: ~$99
- **Link**: [bonobos.com](https://bonobos.com/collections/chinos)

- **Fit note**: "Slim" fit for an athletic build. "Athletic" if quads are particularly developed

#### 9. Amazon Essentials Men's Slim-Fit Stretch Chino
- **Price**: ~$28
- **Link**: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9SD1NG)
- **Colors**: Khaki, Navy, Olive, Stone

---

## 🍷 Section 2: SEMI-FORMAL (Dinner Out, Wine Events, Nice Restaurants)

### Button-Down Shirts

- **Link**: [ctshirts.com](https://www.charlestyrwhitt.com/us/mens-casual-shirts/)
- **Colors**: White, Light Blue, Pink, Sage
- **Why**: CT is the king of men's shirts at this price point. Their linen is breathable and luxurious-looking. The slim fit is cut for shoulders and tapers at the waist — perfect for an athletic build. Light blue linen is the #1 Vegas summer dinner shirt
- **Fit note**: "Slim" or "Extra Slim" depending on torso. CT has excellent size guides

#### 22. J.Crew Baird McNutt Irish Linen Shirt
- **Price**: ~$90
- **Link**: [jcrew.com](https://www.jcrew.com/c/mens/clothing/shirts)
- **Colors**: White, Light Blue, Sage, Navy
- **Why**: Baird McNutt is a premium linen mill. This shirt is airy, slightly textured, and gets better with every wash. The lived-in look of linen is the whole point — don't iron it flat

- **Price**: ~$70
- **Link**: [bananarepublic.com](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=44866)
- **Colors**: Light Indigo, Medium Wash
- **Why**: Chambray is the workhorse between casual and dressy. Pair with chinos and a blazer for wine events, or roll the sleeves with shorts for a nicer brunch. Indispensable

- **Price**: ~$148
- **Link**: [toddsnyder.com](https://www.toddsnyder.com/collections/shirts)

- **Colors**: Navy, Stone, Light Grey
- **Why**: THE summer blazer. Unstructured means no heavy canvas, no shoulder padding — it drapes naturally on an athletic frame. Italian linen breathes in 100°F. Navy is the power move; stone for a softer look

#### 26. J.Crew Ludlow Slim-Fit Unstructured Blazer in Cotton-Linen
- **Price**: ~$248

- **Price**: ~$42
- **Link**: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JFFMFX2)
- **Colors**: Navy, Charcoal, Black
- **Why**: For testing the blazer waters without commitment. Knit construction is forgiving on athletic builds. Won't have the drape of linen, but for $42 it's a solid "blazer over henley" option

- **Price**: ~$150
- **Link**: [colehaan.com](https://www.colehaan.com/grand-ambition-venetian-loafer-british-tan/C33169.html) / [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/cole-haan-grand-ambition-venetian-loafer-men/5917155)

- **Colors**: Sand Suede, Cola Suede, Grey Suede
- **Why**: The OG desert boot. Sand suede is the spring/summer colorway. Pairs equally well with chinos and dark denim. The crepe sole is comfortable for long evenings

#### 33. To Boot New York Aiden Suede Loafer

- **Price**: ~$68
- **Link**: [bonobos.com](https://bonobos.com/collections/belts)

- **Link**: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C3ZP59V)
- **Colors**: Brown, Black, Tan

- **Price**: ~$10
- **Link**: [thetiebar.com](https://www.thetiebar.com/pocket-squares)
- **Colors**: White Linen, Light Blue, Dusty Rose, Sage
- **Why**: A pocket square takes a blazer from "wearing a blazer" to "this guy knows what he's doing." White linen is the classic — just a simple presidential fold. $10 for an instant style upgrade
- **Pro tip**: Don't match your pocket square to your tie. Complement, don't match

#### 37. Nordstrom Men's Silk Pocket Square
- **Price**: ~$30
- **Link**: [nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/c/mens-pocket-squares)
- **Colors**: Burgundy, Navy Pattern, Paisley

## 📝 Care Tips

- **Linen**: Embrace wrinkles — they're the point. Hang to dry. Light steam, never heavy iron
- **Chinos**: Wash cold, hang dry. Ironing is optional — a slight rumple is fine for casual
- **Suits**: Dry clean sparingly (2–3x per season). Hang on proper wooden hangers. Steam between cleans
- **Dress shoes**: Use cedar shoe trees always. Condition leather monthly. Polish before events
- **White sneakers**: Clean weekly. Jason Markk or Magic Eraser. Throw laces in a mesh bag in the wash
- **T-shirts**: Wash inside-out in cold water. Air dry to maintain shape. Replace when they stretch out — they're $15
