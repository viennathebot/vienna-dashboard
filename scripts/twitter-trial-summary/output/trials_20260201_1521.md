### RENOVATE-COMPLEX-PCI: Intravascular Imaging vs Angiography-Guided PCI

**Source:** JACC | **Date:** 2026-01-30
**Link:** https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.example

#### Summary
Intravascular imaging (IVUS/OCT) significantly reduced major adverse cardiac events compared to angiography-guided PCI in complex lesions.

#### Key Findings
- Primary endpoint (MACE at 2yr): 7.7% imaging vs 12.3% angiography (HR 0.64, p<0.001)
- Target vessel failure reduced by 36%
- Stent thrombosis lower with imaging guidance (0.4% vs 1.2%)

#### ✅ Pros
- Robust RCT design with adequate power
- Clinically meaningful endpoints
- Cost-effectiveness analysis included

#### ⚠️ Cons/Limitations
- Open-label design may introduce bias
- Expertise-dependent results may not generalize
- Additional procedural time and cost

### TRISCEND-II: Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement

**Source:** NEJM | **Date:** 2026-01-29
**Link:** https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/example

#### Summary
First RCT showing transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement superior to medical therapy in severe symptomatic TR.

#### Key Findings
- Primary composite endpoint met: 55% vs 32% improvement (p<0.001)
- TR reduction to mild or less: 89% in device group
- Quality of life (KCCQ) improved by 22 points vs 5 points

- Durable TR reduction at 1 year

#### ⚠️ Cons/Limitations
- Small sample size (350 patients)
- Short follow-up (1 year)
- Device-specific results (single valve system)
- 30-day mortality 2.8%

**Source:** Circulation | **Date:** 2026-01-31
**Link:** https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/example

#### Summary
Tirzepatide dramatically improved outcomes in HFpEF patients with obesity, marking a new treatment paradigm.

#### Key Findings

### BEST-CLI 2-Year: Best Endovascular vs Surgical Treatment for CLTI

**Source:** JACC | **Date:** 2026-01-28
**Link:** https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2024.example

#### Summary
2-year follow-up confirms surgical bypass superiority over endovascular therapy for CLTI when adequate saphenous vein is available.

#### Key Findings
- MALE/POD: 42% endo vs 32% surgery in good-vein cohort (p=0.008)
- Amputation-free survival favored surgery: 72% vs 64%
- Reintervention rates 2x higher with endovascular approach
- No difference when no adequate vein available

#### ✅ Pros
- Largest CLTI RCT to date (1,830 patients)
- Stratified by vein availability (pragmatic)
- Long-term follow-up continuing

#### ⚠️ Cons/Limitations
- Surgical expertise variability
- Endovascular techniques rapidly evolving
- High crossover rate (12%)
