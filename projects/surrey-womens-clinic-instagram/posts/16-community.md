Proudly serving Surrey women for over 35 years 💜

Dr. Bleszynski opened her practice near Surrey Memorial Hospital in 1989, and she's been passionate about women's health ever since.

From welcoming new life to supporting women through menopause, our clinic has been part of this community's story.

We're proud to call Surrey home—and grateful to serve the incredible women who trust us with their care.

To our patients past and present: thank you. 🙏
