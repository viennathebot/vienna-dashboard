Tired of planning your life around the nearest bathroom? 🚽

You're not alone. 1 in 3 women experience bladder leakage—but most never talk about it.

The truth? It doesn't have to be your "new normal."

VTone uses gentle electrical muscle stimulation to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles—like doing 15,000 Kegels in one session! 💪

Combined with Morpheus8V, many patients report dramatic improvements in bladder control.
