Self-care isn't selfish—it's necessary. 💆‍♀️

This weekend, we encourage you to do something just for YOU:

🛁 Take a long bath
📖 Read that book you've been meaning to start
☕ Enjoy your coffee in silence
💕 Schedule that health appointment you've been putting off

Your well-being matters. And sometimes, taking care of yourself means asking for help.

If intimate health concerns are affecting your quality of life, know that solutions exist.

We're here when you're ready.

Happy Self-Care Sunday 💜
