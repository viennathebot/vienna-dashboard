Menopause is natural. Suffering through it isn't. 🌸

Common menopause symptoms that we can help with:

• Vaginal dryness & discomfort
• Painful intimacy
• Urinary urgency & leakage
• Decreased sensation
• Changes in vaginal tissue

These symptoms affect up to 80% of menopausal women—but only 7% seek treatment.

Why? Because we've been told to "just deal with it."

Here's the truth: You don't have to.

Non-surgical options like FormaV and Morpheus8V can restore comfort, confidence, and quality of life.

Let's change the conversation. 💜
