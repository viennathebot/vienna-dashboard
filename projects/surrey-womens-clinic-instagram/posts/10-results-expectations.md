What results can you ACTUALLY expect? 📈

We believe in setting realistic expectations. Here's what our patients typically experience:

**AFTER 1 TREATMENT:**
• Some notice immediate improvement
• Mild warmth or sensitivity (temporary)

**AFTER 3 TREATMENTS:**
• Improved vaginal moisture
• Better bladder control
• Enhanced sensation
• Tighter, healthier tissue

**LONG-TERM:**
• Results continue improving for months
• Annual maintenance keeps results optimal

Every woman's experience is unique. During your consultation, Dr. Bleszynski creates a personalized treatment plan just for you.
