**STEMI Recognition & Management for EMS**

*Saving Hearts, Saving Time*

Dr. Peter Bleszynski, MD, FACC, FSCAI  
Director of Cardiology  
North Vista Hospital

March 2026

> **Speaker Notes:** Welcome everyone. I'm Dr. Bleszynski, and today we're going to talk about one of the most time-critical emergencies you'll encounter in the field - STEMI. Your role is crucial. You are literally the difference between a patient walking out of the hospital and one who doesn't.

---

# SLIDE 2: Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

1. **Recognize** classic and atypical STEMI patterns on 12-lead EKG
2. **Identify** common STEMI mimics to avoid false activations
3. **Apply** current guideline-directed prehospital management
4. **Understand** the importance of minimizing door-to-balloon time
5. **Describe** key medications in ACS management

> **Speaker Notes:** These are your takeaways. If nothing else, I want you leaving today able to spot a STEMI quickly, know when it's NOT a STEMI, and get the patient to us as fast as possible.

---

# SLIDE 3: Why STEMI Matters

## Time = Muscle

- **Every 30 minutes of delay** = 7.5% increase in mortality
- Heart muscle dies at ~1 billion cells/hour during occlusion
- After 6 hours: Most damage is irreversible

### The Gold Standard Goals:
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| First Medical Contact to EKG | ≤10 minutes |
| Door-to-Balloon (D2B) | ≤90 minutes |
| **First Medical Contact-to-Device** | **≤90 minutes** |

> **Speaker Notes:** I want this number burned into your memory - every 30 minutes of delay increases mortality by 7.5%. That's not a statistic, that's someone's father, mother, spouse. When you're on scene, the clock is ticking. The old "door-to-balloon" metric has shifted to "first medical contact to device" because YOUR contact starts the clock.

# SLIDE 4: The Chain of Survival

```
🚨 Symptom Onset → 📞 911 Call → 🚑 EMS Arrival → 📊 12-Lead EKG → 📱 Cath Lab Activation → 🏥 Hospital Arrival → 🫀 Wire Crossing
```

**Where EMS Makes the Biggest Impact:**
- Rapid 12-lead acquisition
- Early cath lab activation (field activation)
- Bypass non-PCI facilities when appropriate
- Minimize scene time

> **Speaker Notes:** Look at this chain. You control the middle - and the middle is where we save the most time. Field activation of the cath lab can save 15-20 minutes. That's not just better outcomes - that's lives saved.

# SLIDE 5: Coronary Anatomy 101

## The Big Three

**🔴 LAD (Left Anterior Descending)**
- "The Widow Maker"
- Supplies: Anterior wall, septum, apex
- STEMI: V1-V4

**🟡 LCx (Left Circumflex)**
- Supplies: Lateral wall
- STEMI: I, aVL, V5-V6

**🟢 RCA (Right Coronary Artery)**
- Supplies: Inferior wall, RV, conduction system
- STEMI: II, III, aVF

> **Speaker Notes:** Think of the heart as a house with three main water lines. The LAD is the biggest pipe - when it clogs, the whole front of the house floods. That's why we call it the widow maker. The RCA feeds the bottom of the heart AND the electrical system, which is why inferior STEMIs can cause bradycardia and heart block.

---

# SLIDE 6: STEMI Pathophysiology

## What's Happening Inside

1. **Atherosclerotic plaque ruptures**
2. **Platelet adhesion and aggregation**
3. **Thrombus forms → Complete occlusion**
4. **Myocardium becomes ischemic (minutes)**
5. **Injury pattern appears on EKG (minutes-hours)**
6. **Necrosis/Infarction (hours)**

### Salvageable Myocardium
- **"Ischemic penumbra"** - viable but at risk
- This is what we're racing to save
- Window: Best outcomes within 120 minutes

> **Speaker Notes:** When that plaque ruptures, your body treats it like a wound and tries to clot it. Unfortunately, that clot blocks the entire artery. The muscle downstream starts dying, but not all at once. There's a border zone - the penumbra - that we can still save if we restore flow quickly.

---

# SLIDE 7: EKG Basics Review

## ST-Elevation Criteria

**Definition of STEMI:**
- **Limb leads (I, II, III, aVL, aVF):** ≥1 mm (0.1 mV)
- **Precordial leads (V1-V6):** ≥2 mm (0.2 mV)
- In **≥2 contiguous leads**

### What to Look For:
```
Normal:    ___/\___  (ST at baseline)

STEMI:     ___/‾‾\___  (ST elevated - "tombstone")
```

> **Speaker Notes:** ST elevation is the hallmark. In limb leads, we need 1 mm. In chest leads, we need 2 mm. And it has to be in at least 2 leads that are next to each other - contiguous. One random elevated lead might be artifact or electrode placement issue.

---

# SLIDE 8: Anterior STEMI

## LAD Occlusion - "The Widow Maker"

**EKG Pattern:**
- ST elevation in **V1, V2, V3, V4**
- May extend to V5-V6 if proximal LAD
- Reciprocal depression in inferior leads (II, III, aVF)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Largest territory at risk
- Highest mortality of all STEMI locations
- Often presents with cardiogenic shock
- May develop heart block (septal branches)

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Anterior STEMI]**

> **Speaker Notes:** This is the big one. When you see ST elevation marching across V1 through V4, think "anterior STEMI, call the cath lab NOW." These patients can deteriorate rapidly. The LAD supplies so much muscle that they're at high risk for pump failure.

---

# SLIDE 9: Inferior STEMI

## RCA or LCx Occlusion

**EKG Pattern:**
- ST elevation in **II, III, aVF**
- III > II suggests RCA (most common)
- II > III may suggest LCx
- Reciprocal depression in I, aVL

**⚠️ Critical: Check for RV Involvement!**
- Get **V4R** (right-sided V4)
- ST elevation ≥1mm in V4R = RV infarct
- Changes management!

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Inferior STEMI]**

> **Speaker Notes:** Inferior STEMIs are tricky because they can look "less dramatic" than anterior, but they have their own dangers. The RCA feeds the AV node, so watch for bradycardia and heart block. ALWAYS get a right-sided EKG. If you see V4R elevation, that patient is preload-dependent - nitro and morphine can tank their pressure.

---

# SLIDE 10: Right Ventricular Infarction

## The Preload-Dependent Patient

**When to Suspect:**
- Inferior STEMI on initial EKG
- Hypotension, especially after nitrates
- JVD + clear lungs (paradox)

**V4R is Your Friend:**
- ≥1 mm ST elevation = RV involvement
- Sensitivity highest in first 12 hours

**⚠️ Management Differences:**
- **AVOID:** Nitrates, morphine, diuretics
- **GIVE:** Aggressive IV fluids (preload!)
- May need higher doses to maintain BP

> **Speaker Notes:** This is a critical teaching point. Classic teaching is "give nitro for chest pain." But if they have RV infarct, nitro will drop their preload and their pressure will crater. If you have an inferior STEMI with hypotension, assume RV involvement. Hold the nitro, push fluids.

---

# SLIDE 11: Lateral STEMI

## LCx Occlusion

**EKG Pattern:**
- ST elevation in **I, aVL, V5, V6**
- May be subtle - LCx is the "sneaky" artery
- Reciprocal depression in inferior leads

**Clinical Pearl:**
- Isolated lateral STEMI can be missed
- Look carefully at I and aVL
- Sometimes only 1-2mm of elevation

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Lateral STEMI]**

> **Speaker Notes:** The circumflex is the artery that gets missed most often. It wraps around the back, and its territory doesn't always show up dramatically on a standard 12-lead. If your patient has clear ACS symptoms but the EKG looks "almost normal," look closely at I and aVL. A couple millimeters of elevation there is significant.

---

# SLIDE 12: Posterior STEMI

## The Hidden STEMI

**Standard 12-Lead Shows:**
- **ST depression** in V1-V3 (mirror image!)
- Tall, broad R waves in V1-V2
- Upright T waves in V1-V3

**Gold Standard - Posterior Leads:**
- V7, V8, V9 (left posterior chest)
- ST elevation ≥0.5mm confirms posterior MI

**Often Occurs With:**
- Inferior STEMI (RCA wrapping around)
- Lateral STEMI (LCx)

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Posterior STEMI]**

> **Speaker Notes:** This is the STEMI that standard EKGs miss. You're looking at the heart from the front, but the damage is in the back - so everything looks reversed. Instead of ST elevation, you see ST depression. Instead of Q waves, you see tall R waves. If your patient has crushing chest pain and isolated V1-V3 depression, think posterior STEMI.

---

# SLIDE 13: STEMI Mimics Overview

## Avoiding False Activations

**Common Imposters:**
1. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)
2. Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB)
3. Early Repolarization
4. Pericarditis
5. Brugada Syndrome
6. Hyperkalemia
7. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy

**Why It Matters:**
- False activation disrupts entire hospital
- Unnecessary cath lab risks for patient
- Delays care for real STEMIs
- BUT... when in doubt, activate!

> **Speaker Notes:** Here's the tension we live with - we want to catch every STEMI, but we also don't want to cry wolf. These mimics can look convincing. I'll show you the key features to differentiate them. But remember: if you're genuinely unsure and the patient looks sick, activate. I'd rather have a false positive than miss a real STEMI.

---

# SLIDE 14: STEMI Mimic - LVH

## Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

**Why It Mimics STEMI:**
- Large QRS voltage
- "Strain pattern" = ST depression and T inversion in V5-V6
- BUT can have ST elevation in V1-V3

**How to Differentiate:**
- High voltage (S in V1 + R in V5/V6 > 35mm)
- ST changes are **discordant** (opposite to QRS)
- Proportionate: ST elevation < 25% of S-wave depth
- Patient often has history of HTN

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: LVH with strain]**

> **Speaker Notes:** LVH is common - lots of patients with hypertension have it. The key is discordance. In LVH, the ST segment goes opposite to the main QRS direction. If the QRS is mostly negative in V1-V3, you might see some ST elevation there - but it's proportionate and expected. History helps too - longstanding hypertension points to LVH.

---

# SLIDE 15: STEMI Mimic - LBBB

## Left Bundle Branch Block

**The Classic Problem:**
- LBBB causes secondary ST-T changes
- Makes STEMI diagnosis challenging
- Old teaching: "New LBBB = STEMI equivalent" (outdated!)

**Sgarbossa Criteria (Modified):**
| Finding | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Concordant ST elevation ≥1mm | 5 |
| ST depression ≥1mm in V1-V3 | 3 |
| Discordant ST elevation ≥25% of S-wave | 2 |

**≥3 points suggests STEMI**

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: LBBB with and without STEMI]**

> **Speaker Notes:** LBBB used to be automatic cath lab activation. We've learned that's too aggressive. Now we use Sgarbossa criteria. The key word is "concordant" - if the ST segment goes the SAME direction as the QRS, that's abnormal in LBBB and suggests true ischemia. Discordant changes are expected in LBBB and don't indicate STEMI by themselves.

---

# SLIDE 16: STEMI Mimic - Early Repolarization

## Benign Early Repolarization (BER)

**Classic Features:**
- ST elevation in precordial leads
- "Smiley face" or concave upward morphology
- "Fish hook" or J-point notching
- Often young, healthy patients

**How to Differentiate:**
- **Morphology:** STEMI = convex (frowny) / BER = concave (smiley)
- **Reciprocal changes:** Present in STEMI, absent in BER
- **Dynamic:** STEMI evolves, BER is stable
- **Clinical context:** Chest pain, diaphoresis, etc.

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Early repolarization vs STEMI]**

> **Speaker Notes:** This trips up a lot of people. Young healthy guy, routine EKG shows ST elevation in the chest leads. Key difference: look at the shape. In early repolarization, the ST segment is concave - like a smile. In STEMI, it's convex - like a frown or a tombstone. Also, early repol won't have reciprocal depression and won't evolve over time.

---

# SLIDE 17: STEMI Mimic - Pericarditis

## Inflammation, Not Occlusion

**Classic Features:**
- **Diffuse** ST elevation (not following coronary distribution)
- PR depression (especially in II, highly specific)
- PR elevation in aVR
- No reciprocal changes
- Saddle-shaped or concave ST morphology

**Clinical Clues:**
- Sharp, pleuritic chest pain
- Worse with inspiration, better sitting forward
- Recent viral illness
- Friction rub on exam

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Pericarditis]**

> **Speaker Notes:** Pericarditis is inflammation of the sac around the heart, not a blocked artery. The EKG changes are everywhere - diffuse ST elevation that doesn't match any coronary territory. The PR segment clue is gold - look at lead II. If you see PR depression, think pericarditis. The pain is also different - sharp, worse with breathing, better leaning forward.

---

# SLIDE 18: STEMI Mimic - Brugada Pattern

## The Dangerous Look-Alike

**Type 1 Brugada Pattern:**
- **Coved** ST elevation ≥2mm in V1-V2
- Followed by negative T wave
- Right bundle branch block pattern
- Can look like anteroseptal STEMI

**Why It Matters:**
- Genetic channelopathy
- Risk of sudden cardiac death
- NOT a coronary occlusion
- Cath lab won't find anything

**Clinical Context:**
- Often younger patients, males
- May have family history of sudden death
- Can be triggered by fever, drugs

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Brugada pattern]**

> **Speaker Notes:** Brugada can fool you because it has coved ST elevation in V1-V2, right where you'd see an anterior STEMI. The key is the shape and the T-wave - that immediate downslope into a negative T-wave is classic Brugada. These patients need an EP study and probably a defibrillator, not a stent.

---

# SLIDE 19: STEMI Mimic - Hyperkalemia

## Potassium Killing the Conduction System

**Progressive EKG Changes:**
1. **Mild (5.5-6.5):** Peaked, narrow T waves
2. **Moderate (6.5-7.5):** PR prolongation, P wave flattening, QRS widening
3. **Severe (>7.5):** Sine wave pattern, VF, asystole

**Why It Can Mimic STEMI:**
- Wide QRS can look like STEMI
- ST elevation may appear
- But pattern doesn't fit coronary territory

**Clinical Context:**
- Dialysis patient
- Renal failure
- Medication effects (ACEi, K-sparing diuretics)

**[INSERT EKG IMAGE: Hyperkalemia progression]**

> **Speaker Notes:** Hyperkalemia is the great mimicker. Those peaked T-waves can look like hyperacute T-waves of early STEMI. As it progresses, the QRS widens and can have ST elevation that doesn't fit any pattern. Always ask: is this patient a dialysis patient? Any kidney problems? That context is crucial.

# SLIDE 20: Prehospital Management Overview

## What to Do in the Field

### Immediate Actions (MONA is Outdated!)

**DO:**
- ✅ 12-lead EKG within 10 minutes
- ✅ Activate cath lab if STEMI
- ✅ Aspirin 324mg (chewed, non-enteric)
- ✅ IV access, cardiac monitor
- ✅ O2 only if SpO2 <90%

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Routine oxygen in normoxic patients
- ❌ Morphine as first-line (associated with worse outcomes)
- ❌ Delay transport for interventions
- ❌ P2Y12 inhibitors without physician direction

> **Speaker Notes:** Let's talk about what's changed. MONA - morphine, oxygen, nitro, aspirin - is outdated. Studies showed routine oxygen doesn't help and might hurt. Morphine is associated with worse outcomes in some studies. Aspirin is still king. Get that EKG fast and call us.

---

# SLIDE 21: Aspirin - Still the King

## First-Line Antiplatelet

**Dose:** 324mg (four 81mg tablets)
**Route:** Chewed, non-enteric coated
**Timing:** As soon as STEMI recognized

**Why Chewed?**
- Faster absorption (15-20 min vs 60 min)
- Buccal absorption even if vomiting

**Contraindications:**
- True aspirin allergy (rare)
- Active GI bleed
- NOT held for: CABG possibility, anticoagulation

> **Speaker Notes:** Aspirin has been proven over and over to reduce mortality in MI. Chew it - don't swallow it whole. The faster it gets into the system, the faster it starts blocking platelets from piling onto that clot. Even if the patient might need bypass surgery, we still give aspirin.

---

# SLIDE 22: Nitroglycerin - Use with Caution

## Preload Reduction and Vasodilation

**Indication:** Ongoing chest pain, hypertension, pulmonary edema

**Standard Dose:** 0.4mg SL every 5 min x3

**⚠️ HOLD if:**
- SBP <90 mmHg
- Recent PDE-5 inhibitor (Viagra, Cialis, Levitra)
  - Sildenafil/Vardenafil: within 24 hours
  - Tadalafil: within 48 hours
- Suspected **RV infarction** (inferior STEMI + hypotension)
- Severe aortic stenosis

> **Speaker Notes:** Nitro is great for symptom relief, but you need to be careful. Always ask about erectile dysfunction meds - nitro + Viagra = severe hypotension. And remember what we said about RV infarct - those patients are preload dependent. Nitro will drop their pressure fast.

---

# SLIDE 23: Oxygen - Less is More

## 2023 Guidelines Update

**Current Recommendation:**
- Supplemental O2 **only if SpO2 <90%**
- Target: 90-94%
- Avoid hyperoxia (>96%)

**Why the Change?**
- AVOID trial: Routine O2 in normoxic STEMI showed no benefit
- DETO2X-AMI: Possible harm with hyperoxia
- Hyperoxia may cause coronary vasoconstriction

**Exception:**
- Respiratory distress
- Heart failure with hypoxia
- Cardiogenic shock

> **Speaker Notes:** This is a big change from how many of us were trained. We used to put everyone on oxygen. Now we know that's not helping and might be hurting. If their sat is fine, leave the oxygen off. Focus on getting them to the cath lab.

---

# SLIDE 24: Morphine - The Fallen Hero

## Use Sparingly

**Historical Role:** Pain relief, anxiety reduction, preload reduction

**Current Evidence:**
- Associated with increased mortality in some studies
- May delay P2Y12 inhibitor absorption (slows gut)
- Can cause hypotension and respiratory depression
- Still has a role, but not first-line

**When to Consider:**
- Severe pain unresponsive to nitrates
- Pulmonary edema (preload reduction)
- Always with naloxone available

> **Speaker Notes:** Morphine used to be automatic for MI. Now we know it might actually increase mortality - possibly because it slows gut absorption of the antiplatelet drugs we give in the ER. If the patient is in severe pain and nitro isn't touching it, morphine is still an option, but use it judiciously.

---

# SLIDE 25: Cath Lab Activation

## You Hold the Power

**Field Activation Saves Lives:**
- Bypasses ED delay
- Team mobilized before arrival
- Can reduce FMC-to-device by 15-20 minutes

**What to Communicate:**
- Patient age, sex
- Symptom onset time
- EKG interpretation
- Vitals, mental status
- Any complications (arrest, shock)
- ETA

**North Vista STEMI Line: [INSERT NUMBER]**

> **Speaker Notes:** This is where you make the biggest difference. When you activate from the field, you skip the whole ED workup. Our cath team is in the room, gowned and ready when you roll in. That time savings translates directly to muscle saved.

---

# SLIDE 26: Transport Decisions

## Time vs. Distance

**Direct to PCI Center if:**
- STEMI identified in field
- PCI center is within 60-90 minutes
- Patient hemodynamically stable enough for transport

**Nearest ED First if:**
- Cardiac arrest
- Cardiogenic shock requiring stabilization
- Unclear diagnosis
- PCI center >120 minutes

**Consider Helicopter Transport if:**
- Ground transport >60 minutes to PCI center
- Weather and landing zone permit

> **Speaker Notes:** The decision tree: if it's a clear STEMI and you can get them to a PCI center in reasonable time, go direct. But if they're in cardiac arrest or shock, they might need stabilization first. Use good judgment and communicate with medical control.

---

# SLIDE 27: What Happens in the Cath Lab

## Primary PCI

**The Procedure:**
1. Access (femoral or radial artery)
2. Coronary angiography (identify culprit)
3. Wire crosses the lesion
4. Balloon angioplasty
5. Stent deployment
6. Post-dilation and optimization

**Goal: FMC-to-Device <90 minutes**

**Outcomes:**
- Mortality: 3-5% in uncomplicated STEMI
- 95%+ success rate in opening artery
- Most patients home in 2-3 days

> **Speaker Notes:** Here's what we do once they arrive. We go through an artery - usually in the wrist now - thread a wire through the blockage, inflate a balloon to open it, and place a stent to keep it open. The whole thing takes 30-60 minutes usually. If everything goes smoothly, many patients are walking out of the hospital in a couple days.

---

# SLIDE 28: When PCI Isn't Available

## Fibrinolytic Therapy

**Consider if:**
- PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes
- No contraindications to fibrinolytics

**Door-to-Needle Goal:** <30 minutes

**Absolute Contraindications:**
- Prior intracranial hemorrhage
- Known cerebral vascular malformation
- Ischemic stroke within 3 months
- Active bleeding or bleeding diathesis
- Significant closed head trauma within 3 months
- Suspected aortic dissection

> **Speaker Notes:** If a patient is at a hospital without a cath lab and transfer time is too long, fibrinolytics are an option. But they're not as effective as PCI and have bleeding risks. Most urban settings can get patients to PCI within 120 minutes, so lytics are more relevant in rural areas.

---

# SLIDE 29: Cardiogenic Shock

## When the Pump Fails

**Definition:**
- SBP <90 despite adequate filling
- Signs of end-organ hypoperfusion
- Cardiac index <2.2 L/min/m²

**Occurs in ~5-8% of STEMI**

**Management:**
- Still need PCI (primary treatment)
- Vasopressors (norepinephrine preferred)
- Mechanical support:
  - **Impella** - percutaneous LVAD
  - **IABP** - intra-aortic balloon pump
  - **ECMO** - for refractory shock

**Mortality: 40-50%**

> **Speaker Notes:** Cardiogenic shock is when the heart can't pump enough to perfuse the body. These patients are in big trouble - 50% mortality even with everything we do. But PCI is still the answer. We just need to support them mechanically while we open the artery.

---

# SLIDE 30: Medications Summary

## The ACS Arsenal

| Class | Drug | Timing |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Antiplatelet** | Aspirin 324mg | EMS (chewed) |
| | P2Y12 (ticagrelor, prasugrel) | ED/Cath lab |
| **Anticoagulant** | Heparin | ED/Cath lab |
| **Vasodilator** | Nitroglycerin | PRN for pain |
| **Beta-blocker** | Metoprolol | Within 24h if stable |
| **ACEi/ARB** | Lisinopril | Within 24h if stable |
| **Statin** | Atorvastatin 80mg | Before discharge |

> **Speaker Notes:** Here's your medication summary. Your job in the field: Aspirin. That's the big one. Everything else we handle in the ED and cath lab. Don't delay transport to start IVs or give other medications.

---

# SLIDE 31: Special Scenario - Cardiac Arrest with STEMI

## ROSC Achieved - Now What?

**If STEMI on post-ROSC EKG:**
- Immediate cath lab activation
- Transport to PCI center
- Consider targeted temperature management
- May need mechanical support

**If No STEMI but Suspected Cardiac Etiology:**
- Still may benefit from angiography
- Discuss with receiving facility
- ~30% of OHCA have culprit lesion

> **Speaker Notes:** When you get ROSC after cardiac arrest and the EKG shows STEMI, treat it like any other STEMI - get them to the cath lab. But here's the thing: even without obvious STEMI, many cardiac arrest patients have coronary disease. Communicate with the receiving hospital.

---

# SLIDE 32: Special Scenario - Elderly/Frail Patients

## Considerations

**Same Time Goals Apply!**
- Age alone is not a contraindication to PCI
- Outcomes worse but still benefit from reperfusion

**Considerations:**
- Higher bleeding risk
- Atypical presentations more common
- More comorbidities
- Discuss goals of care when appropriate

**Adjust Communication:**
- More hearing impairment
- May be confused or delirious
- Involve family when possible

> **Speaker Notes:** Don't let age fool you into thinking someone doesn't deserve aggressive treatment. An 80-year-old with STEMI still benefits from PCI. Yes, their risk is higher, but so is their benefit. Treat the patient, not the age.

---

# SLIDE 33: Special Scenario - Cocaine-Associated MI

## Young Patient, Real STEMI

**Mechanism:**
- Coronary vasospasm
- Accelerated atherosclerosis
- Prothrombotic state
- Increased myocardial oxygen demand

**Management Differences:**
- Benzodiazepines first-line for agitation
- **AVOID beta-blockers** (unopposed alpha)
- Nitrates are helpful
- PCI if true STEMI with thrombus

> **Speaker Notes:** Young patient with chest pain, think cocaine. The management is different - we avoid beta-blockers because they can cause unopposed alpha stimulation and worsen coronary spasm. Benzos and nitrates are your friends here. If there's true thrombus causing STEMI, they still need the cath lab.

---

# SLIDE 34: Case Study 1

## 62-year-old Male

**Chief Complaint:** Crushing chest pressure x 45 minutes

**History:** HTN, DM, former smoker

**Vitals:** HR 88, BP 156/92, SpO2 97% RA

**EKG:** [INSERT ANTERIOR STEMI EKG]

**Questions:**
1. What type of STEMI is this?
2. What artery is likely occluded?
3. What are your immediate actions?

> **Speaker Notes:** Let's work through this together. [Allow audience participation] This is a classic anterior STEMI - ST elevation V1-V4. The LAD is the culprit. Actions: Aspirin 324mg chewed, activate cath lab, transport. Don't delay for IV or nitro.

---

# SLIDE 35: Case Study 2

## 71-year-old Female

**Chief Complaint:** Chest discomfort, nausea x 2 hours

**History:** HTN, CKD stage 3

**Vitals:** HR 48, BP 88/54, SpO2 94% RA

**EKG:** [INSERT INFERIOR STEMI WITH RV INVOLVEMENT EKG]

**Questions:**
1. What type of STEMI is this?
2. Why is she bradycardic and hypotensive?
3. What should you do (and NOT do)?

> **Speaker Notes:** Inferior STEMI - II, III, aVF. She's bradycardic because the RCA feeds the AV node. She's hypotensive - suspect RV involvement. Get V4R! Do NOT give nitro - it will tank her pressure further. Give fluids, give aspirin, transport urgently.

---

# SLIDE 36: Case Study 3

## 28-year-old Male

**Chief Complaint:** Sharp chest pain, worse with deep breath

**History:** URI 1 week ago, no cardiac history

**Vitals:** HR 102, BP 128/78, SpO2 99% RA

**EKG:** [INSERT PERICARDITIS EKG]

**Questions:**
1. Is this STEMI?
2. What features point to the real diagnosis?
3. Should you activate the cath lab?

> **Speaker Notes:** This is pericarditis, NOT STEMI. Key features: diffuse ST elevation not following coronary territories, PR depression in II, young patient with recent viral illness, pleuritic pain. No cath lab needed. He needs NSAIDs and colchicine, not a stent.

---

# SLIDE 37: Summary - Key Take-Home Points

## Remember These

1. **Time = Muscle** - Every minute counts
2. **Get the EKG early** - Within 10 minutes of contact
3. **Activate early** - Field activation saves 15-20 minutes
4. **Know your mimics** - But when in doubt, activate
5. **Aspirin is king** - 324mg chewed, always
6. **Watch for RV infarct** - Check V4R on inferior STEMIs
7. **Oxygen only if needed** - SpO2 <90%
8. **Less morphine** - Use judiciously

> **Speaker Notes:** If you remember nothing else from today, remember these eight points. You are the front line. Your rapid recognition and action determines whether these patients have a good outcome or a bad one.
