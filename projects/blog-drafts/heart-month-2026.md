# American Heart Month: How Structural Heart Interventions Are Changing Lives

*February 2026 | By Dr. Peter Bleszynski, MD, FACC*

February is American Heart Month—a time to raise awareness about heart disease and the innovative treatments that can help patients live longer, healthier lives. As an interventional cardiologist in Las Vegas, I've had the privilege of offering life-changing procedures to patients who once had limited options. Today, I want to share how structural heart disease treatment has evolved and what it might mean for you or someone you love.

## What Is Structural Heart Disease?

Structural heart disease refers to problems with the heart's valves, walls, or chambers. These conditions—such as aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or atrial fibrillation—can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and significantly impact quality of life. For decades, open-heart surgery was the only option for many of these conditions. But not everyone is a candidate for traditional surgery, especially older adults or those with other health concerns.

That's where minimally invasive structural heart interventions come in.

## Three Procedures Transforming Cardiac Care

### TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement)

TAVR has revolutionized how we treat severe aortic stenosis—a condition where the aortic valve narrows and restricts blood flow. Instead of open-heart surgery, we guide a new valve through a small incision in the leg and position it inside the diseased valve. Most patients go home within 1-2 days and experience dramatic symptom improvement.

For patients seeking **TAVR in Las Vegas**, this procedure offers a faster recovery, less pain, and excellent long-term outcomes—even for those previously told they were "too high-risk" for surgery.

### Watchman (Left Atrial Appendage Closure)

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) face an increased risk of stroke, often requiring lifelong blood thinners. The Watchman device offers an alternative. This small implant seals off the left atrial appendage—where most stroke-causing blood clots form in AFib patients—allowing many patients to reduce or eliminate their blood thinner medications.

For those who struggle with the bleeding risks or lifestyle limitations of anticoagulants, Watchman can be genuinely life-changing.

### MitraClip (Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair)

Mitral regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve doesn't close properly, causing blood to leak backward in the heart. The MitraClip procedure repairs the valve through a catheter, reducing leakage without open-heart surgery. Patients often notice improved breathing and energy levels within weeks.

## Is Structural Heart Intervention Right for You?

You may be a candidate for one of these procedures if you:

- Have been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or atrial fibrillation
- Experience symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, or chest discomfort
- Have been told you're not a candidate for traditional open-heart surgery
- Want to explore alternatives to lifelong blood thinner therapy
- Are looking for a faster recovery with less surgical risk

Every patient is unique. A thorough evaluation—including imaging and a detailed review of your medical history—helps determine which approach offers the best outcome for your specific situation.

## Why Choose a Structural Heart Specialist?

These procedures require specialized training and experience. As **Director of Cardiology at North Vista Hospital** and a fellowship-trained interventional and structural cardiologist, I perform TAVR, MitraClip, Watchman, PFO/ASD closures, and complex coronary interventions regularly. My goal is to provide patients throughout the Las Vegas valley with access to the most advanced cardiac care available.

If you're searching for an **interventional cardiologist** or information about **structural heart disease in Las Vegas**, I encourage you to learn about your options. Many patients are surprised to discover they have alternatives they didn't know existed.

## Take the Next Step This Heart Month

Heart disease doesn't have to limit your life. If you or a loved one has been living with valve disease, AFib, or symptoms that haven't been adequately addressed, now is the time to explore your options.

**Schedule a consultation** to discuss whether a structural heart intervention might be right for you. Together, we can create a treatment plan focused on helping you feel better and live more fully.
