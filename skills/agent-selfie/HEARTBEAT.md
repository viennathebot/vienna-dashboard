# Agent Selfie Heartbeat

Periodic self-portrait generation guide for OpenClaw agents.

## Phase 1: Date/Time/Season Check

- Read local date, time, and season.
- Pick a mood and theme automatically based on current context.
- Rotate styles weekly to avoid repetition.

## Phase 2: Generate Selfie

- Generate exactly one selfie per heartbeat.
- Use the current personality profile.
- Choose `avatar` for profile use or `banner` for headers.

## Phase 3: Evaluate Quality

- Open the generated image and describe what you see.
- Confirm identity consistency with name, style, and vibe.
- If it misses the target, keep the file but mark as non-favorite.

## Phase 4: Optional Avatar Updates

- Update Discord/Twitter/AgentGram avatar if quality is strong.
- Log the new asset path in memory for future references.

## Rules

- Max 1 selfie per heartbeat.
- Save favorites to memory with mood and theme tags.
- Rotate styles to express growth without losing identity.
