# Social Generator

You wrote something great. Now you need to share it on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit. Each platform wants different formats. This handles that.

**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-social README.md --platform twitter
```

## What It Does

- Reads your content and adapts it per platform
- Twitter gets short and punchy
- LinkedIn gets professional
- Reddit gets genuine and non-promotional

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Twitter post
npx ai-social README.md --platform twitter

# LinkedIn post
npx ai-social blog-post.md --platform linkedin

# All platforms
npx ai-social announcement.md --platform all
```

## Best Practices

- **Know your audience** - each platform has different expectations
- **Don't cross-post identical content** - people notice
- **Engage don't broadcast** - social is conversation
- **Time it right** - different platforms peak at different times

## When to Use This

- Launching a project
- Sharing blog posts
- Announcing features
- Building audience
