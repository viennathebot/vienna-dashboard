## The URMC / Dr. Ling Situation
- In 2025, explored returning to University of Rochester for an interventional/structural position
- Dr. Ling initially offered a position via email (September 2025)
- After Peter flew out and interviewed, Ling backpedaled, hired someone else, reduced terms from the original offer, and ultimately ghosted Peter
- The staff and nurses at URMC still ask about Peter regularly - he was well-liked during fellowship
- Peter decided the opportunity was not worth pursuing given the lack of professionalism
- Maintaining cordial but distant contact; Dr. Ling potentially retiring in ~5 years
- Peter's wife has Rochester connections, which made it geographically appealing
