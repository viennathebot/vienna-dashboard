<h1>Cardiology Literature Roundup</h1>
<h2>February 4, 2026 Morning Brief</h2>
<p>Prepared for Dr. Peter Bleszynski, MD, FACC, FSCAI</p>
<hr>
<h2>🫀 STRUCTURAL HEART</h2>
<h3>1. NAVULTRA Registry: Navitor vs SAPIEN 3 Ultra in Small Annuli</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> EuroIntervention, February 2, 2026</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Multicenter real-world registry comparing outcomes between the self-expanding Navitor valve and balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 Ultra in patients with small aortic annuli.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<li>Head-to-head comparison in challenging small annulus anatomy</li>
<li>Real-world data applicable to clinical practice</li>
<li>Provides guidance for device selection in smaller patients</li>
<p><strong>Clinical Relevance:</strong> Directly applicable to your TAVR program when planning cases in patients with smaller annuli.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. DurAVR Biomimetic THV: 30-Day Outcomes in Small Annuli</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Recent publication, February 2026</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Novel leaflet design biomimetic transcatheter heart valve demonstrating promising early results in small aortic annuli.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<li>High technical success rates</li>
<li>Favorable hemodynamic outcomes at 30 days</li>
<li>Novel biomimetic approach to valve design</li>
<p><strong>Clinical Relevance:</strong> Emerging technology to watch — another potential tool in the pipeline for challenging small annulus cases.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Residual Mean Gradient After TAVR Predicts Long-Term Outcomes</h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Palmerini et al.</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> February 2026</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Analysis of post-procedural residual mean pressure gradients and their association with structural valve deterioration and mortality.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<li>Early residual MPG independently predicts structural valve deterioration</li>
<li>Associated with bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF)</li>
<li>Linked to increased 10-year mortality</li>
<p><strong>Clinical Takeaway:</strong> Don't ignore post-procedural gradients. Careful attention to hemodynamic results at time of implant may have long-term implications.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔧 INTERVENTIONAL</h2>
<h3>4. 3D ICE in Structural Interventions: Expert Review</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> EuroIntervention, February 4, 2026</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Comprehensive expert review on the use of 3-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography for guiding structural heart procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Applications Covered:</strong></p>
<li>TAVR guidance</li>
<li>Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO)</li>
<li>PFO/ASD closures</li>
<li>Other structural interventions</li>
<p><strong>Clinical Relevance:</strong> Worth reading if you're considering expanding ICE use in your practice — offers high-resolution imaging without the need for TEE and general anesthesia.</p>
<hr>
<h3>5. Leadless vs. Transvenous Pacemakers Post-Valve Surgery</h3>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> With growing rates of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR and valve surgery, this analysis compares outcomes between leadless pacemakers (Micra) and conventional transvenous pacing.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Relevance:</strong> Useful for post-procedure decision-making when patients require permanent pacing after structural interventions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>⚡ QUICK HITS</h2>
<h3>M-TEER + GDMT Superiority Confirmed</h3>
<p>Updated meta-analysis confirms that mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) combined with guideline-directed medical therapy reduces death and heart failure hospitalization at 24 months compared to GDMT alone in functional MR.</p>
<h3>AF Common After PFO Closure</h3>
<p>Implantable cardiac monitor study found high incidence of asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation following PFO closure, with significant late-onset events occurring beyond 30 days post-procedure. Implications for monitoring strategy.</p>
<h3>Exercise-Based Cardiac Rehab Benefits TAVR Patients</h3>
<p>RCT meta-analysis supports functional benefit of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation after TAVR, even in patients with successful aortic stenosis correction.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This week's literature continues to advance our understanding of:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Device selection</strong> in challenging anatomies (small annuli)</p>
<p>2. <strong>Procedural optimization</strong> (residual gradients matter)</p>
<p>3. <strong>Imaging advances</strong> (3D ICE expanding indications)</p>
<p>4. <strong>Post-procedure management</strong> (pacing strategies, rehab, AF monitoring)</p>
