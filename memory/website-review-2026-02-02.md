# Website Review: drbleszynski.com
**Date:** February 2, 2026

## Overall Assessment
Site is live, loads well, professionally designed. Good foundation but opportunities for improvement.

## ✅ What's Working
- Clean, professional design
- Mobile-responsive
- Good page structure (Home, About, Services, Contact, Blog)
- Credentials prominently displayed (FACC, FSCAI)
- Comprehensive services page covering all procedures
- Two office locations with addresses
- SEO-friendly title tags ("Interventional Cardiologist Las Vegas")

## ⚠️ Issues Found

### 1. **Stale Blog Content**
- Both blog posts dated "January 2025" - over 1 year old
- Only 2 articles total
- Recommendation: Add 1-2 new posts per month

### 2. **Missing Phone Number**
- Contact page shows only fax numbers
- No main office phone number visible
- **ACTION NEEDED**: Add phone number to contact page

### 3. **No Patient Reviews/Testimonials**

- Procedure explanation videos would differentiate from competitors
- Patient education videos build trust
