## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: DMV Reminder Failed
- Cron jobs for DMV reminders (3:15 PM and 3:45 PM) did NOT fire
- Jobs had `sessionTarget: "main"` and `wakeMode: "next-heartbeat"`
- The "at" scheduler doesn't actively push - it waits for heartbeats
- **FIX FOR FUTURE**: Use `sessionTarget: "isolated"` with `deliver: true` for time-critical reminders
- Dr. B messaged at 3:30 PM asking about missing reminder
- Manually sent DMV alert immediately

## Morning Session

### Vienna Image Generation Project
- **Craiyon**: Generated 8 looks (saved to workspace/images/)
  - Office Chic, Night Out, Casual Weekend, Fitness
  - Early Morning, Before Bed, Getting Ready, Winding Down
- **Ideogram.ai**: Account created (@viennathebot via Google)
  - Free tier, higher quality than Craiyon
  - Generated: Office Chic, Coffee Shop, Beach Vacation, Date Night (in progress)
- Sent 8 Craiyon images to Dr. B at 8:35 AM
- Dr. B will review and give feedback later

### Project Status Update (sent to Dr. B)
- ✅ Case Logger - DONE (port 3847)
- 🔄 Renal Denervation Kit - Next priority
- 📋 Dashboard v2.0 - Queued
- 📋 Research Summarizer - Queued
- 📋 Twitter Trial Bot - Queued

### Reminders
- DMV appointment at 4:15 PM (cron jobs set for 3:45 PM reminder)

### Notes
- Dr. B at Fort Apache clinic 9 AM - 5 PM today
- Ideogram produces noticeably better quality than Craiyon
- **Playground AI** also generates excellent quality images!
- Leonardo.ai still needs email verification

## Afternoon Session (3:30 PM)

### DMV Reminder Failure
- Dr. B asked why reminder didn't work at 3:30 PM
- DMV appointment was at 4:15 PM
- Manually alerted him immediately
- Explained the cron configuration issue

### Vienna Images Sent
- Sent 7 new Ideogram looks (Office, Coffee Shop, Beach, Date Night, Wine Tasting, Yoga, Cooking)
- Sent 1 Playground AI image (Office Chic - very high quality!)
- Total images sent today: 8 Craiyon + 7 Ideogram + 1 Playground = 16 looks

### Lesson Learned
- Keep working on tasks in background between heartbeats
- Don't stop working just because user said "have a good day"
- Critical reminders need isolated sessions with direct delivery

## Evening Session (6:20 PM)

### Crash/Reset Investigation
**What happened:** Vienna lost personality/context (woke up blank) — SOUL.md and USER.md weren't loading properly from workspace.

**How it was fixed:**
```bash
cp ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/SOUL.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md
cp ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/USER.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/USER.md
npx openclaw gateway restart
```

**Prevention steps:**
1. Keep workspace files in sync with agent config folder
2. Workspace is source of truth — edit there, backup to agent folder
3. If Vienna seems "blank," check if SOUL.md/USER.md exist in workspace
4. Synced USER.md back to agent config folder (had newer info)

### Projects Status Update
- ✅ Landing page created at localhost:8080 (Vienna Command Center)
- ✅ Gallery page created at localhost:8080/images/
- ⚠️ Ideogram out of credits (resets in 2 days)

### Nano Banana Investigation
**Nano Banana = Google Gemini's AI image generator (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)**
- Available in: Playground AI, Gemini, Google AI Studio
- Free tier: 1,000 edits/month on Playground
- Features: Consistent characters, photo editing, style blending, chat-based
- Considered one of the best AI image generators available

### Google Drive Access Confirmed
- Logged in as viennathebot@gmail.com via browser
- **"Vi" shared folder** from Dr. B accessible (currently empty)
- Can use for storing completed work and file management
- Storage: 37.2 MB of 15 GB used

### Self-Improvement Updates
- Added heartbeat file check to HEARTBEAT.md (verify SOUL.md/USER.md exist)
- Updated TOOLS.md with all account info, AI generators, network details
- Documented crash recovery procedure

## Evening Session (7:53 PM)

### Heartbeat Check
- ✅ SOUL.md and USER.md verified present in workspace
- ⚠️ Bird CLI timing out on all commands - needs cookie auth setup for Twitter follows
- 📦 Gemini Vienna portrait generated earlier (1.6 MB) - download location TBD
