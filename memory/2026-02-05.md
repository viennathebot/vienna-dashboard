## ~7:55 AM — Dashboard Password Protection ✅

### Part 1: JavaScript Password Gate (LIVE)
- Created `auth.js` — full-screen password overlay with SHA-256 hash verification
- Password: `Vienna2026!` (stored as SHA-256 hash, NOT plaintext)
- Features:
  - Dark theme matching dashboard (#0f172a bg, #e11d48 accent)
  - 🫀 logo + "Vienna Dashboard" title
  - sessionStorage flag (no re-entry during same browser session)
  - Smooth fade-out animation on unlock
  - Shake animation on wrong password
- Added `<script src="auth.js"></script>` to **27 HTML files** across all directories
- Proper relative paths for each depth level (auth.js, ../auth.js, ../../auth.js, etc.)
- Files modified: index.html, todo.html, workout.html, tavr-planning.html, valentines.html, cardiology-research-summary.html, plus all subdirectory pages (japan-trip, surrey-womens-clinic, audi-a7-maintenance, projects/*, research-briefs/*, tavr-cases/*, dashboard/, images/, style-guide/)
- Committed: `dc9e472` — "Add password gate to all dashboard pages"
- Pushed to GitHub, deployed via GitHub Pages
- **Verified working** at https://viennathebot.github.io/vienna-dashboard/
  - Password overlay shows correctly (🫀 logo, dark theme)
  - Correct password reveals dashboard content
  - Content hidden until authenticated

### Part 2: Migration Research (Document Only)
- Created `memory/dashboard-hosting-migration.md`
- **Recommendation: Cloudflare Pages + Cloudflare Access**
  - Free tier: unlimited sites, 500 builds/month, unlimited bandwidth
  - Cloudflare Access: FREE server-side auth for up to 50 users
  - Options: OTP email, GitHub OAuth, Google OAuth
  - Migration: just connect GitHub repo, zero workflow changes
- Vercel: great platform but password protection requires Pro ($20/mo)
- Netlify: same — password protection requires Pro ($19/mo)
- **No migration performed** — just the research doc
- Phase plan: JS gate now → Cloudflare Pages later → custom domain optional
