## GitHub Pages Deployment Fix (~6:10 AM)

### Issue
- GitHub Pages deployments were failing (#5, #6, #7, #8)

2. Re-added the actual files as regular files
3. Committed and pushed

### Result

- AI Studio Nano Banana produces 1024x1024 HD PNGs (~2MB each)
- Fixed new chat flow: click "New chat" button → "Discard and continue" (not Page.navigate which kills WS)
- **Batch 1 complete**: Images #23-29 (7 images) → pushed to GitHub (commit 2041eee)
