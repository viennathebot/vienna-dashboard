## GitHub Pages Deployment Fix (~6:10 AM)

### Issue
- GitHub Pages deployments were failing (#5, #6, #7, #8)
- Root cause: broken submodule reference for `projects/vienna-dashboard`
- The embedded .git directory from earlier created a "gitlink" without proper .gitmodules

### Fix
1. Removed the cached submodule entry: `git rm --cached projects/vienna-dashboard`
2. Re-added the actual files as regular files
3. Committed and pushed

### Result
- Deployment #9 succeeded! ✅
- Dashboard now live at: https://viennathebot.github.io/vienna-dashboard/

### Dashboard Features Now Working
- Today's Schedule with daily update
- Upcoming This Week section
- Full Schedule page with STEMI call dates
- Morning Briefs history with PDF downloads
- Project Ideas (High Priority, Backlog, Completed)
- Vienna Gallery with 30+ images
- All sidebar navigation links functional
