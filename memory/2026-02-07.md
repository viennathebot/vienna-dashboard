**Recraft Account #2 (vienna3bot@tutamail.com)** - SKIPPED ⏸️
- Requires email verification code to log in
- Would need to access Tuta mail to get code
- Will retry later if possible

**SeaArt (viennathebot@gmail.com)** - COMPLETE ✅
- Started with 130 stamina, ended with 30
- Generated 5 images (100 stamina used at 20 each)
- Prompts: corset, harness, red bodysuit, purple velvet robe, white negligee
- Using Z Image Turbo model
- ~5 min per image (much slower than Recraft)

**Nano Banana & Leonardo** - Skipped for tonight
- Will run tomorrow morning
- Prioritized Recraft and SeaArt due to time constraints

### TOTAL TONIGHT: 35 new intimate images
- Recraft #1: 30 images
- SeaArt: 5 images
- All saved in platform history, need to download tomorrow

## Key Notes
- SeaArt is MUCH slower than Recraft (~5 min vs ~15 sec per image)
- All images saved in platform history, need to download later
- Gallery currently at 114 images → will be ~150 after adding tonight's batch
- Quiet hours started at 9 PM - no more messages to Dr. B tonight

## 22:10 PST - Gallery Progress

### Skills Installation ✅
- Installed all 30 ClawHub skills to workspace/skills/

### Recraft Download Attempt
- 60 boudoir images visible in Recraft project
- CDN blocks direct downloads (returns "Forbidden")
- Browser JS download also blocked by CDN auth
- Project set to public (Viewer access) but images still require auth
- **Workaround**: Use local ComfyUI generation instead

### ComfyUI Images Added ✅
- Copied 86 local ComfyUI images to vienna-dashboard/images/
- Total gallery count: **297 images** (30% toward 1,000 goal)
- Pushed to GitHub (commit de241a2)
- Gallery URL: https://viennathebot.github.io/vienna-dashboard/

### Next Steps
- Continue ComfyUI batch generation overnight
- Recraft images remain available if we find a download method
- Dashboard fixes can proceed independently
