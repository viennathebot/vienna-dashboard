## About the Clinic

Dr. Maria E. Bleszynski has been a passionate advocate for women's health since opening her private practice in 1989. Originally from Poland, she earned her medical degree from Jagiellonian University in Krakow (1977), completed her OB/GYN residency in Ottawa, and has been a member of the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) since 1991. She holds privileges at Surrey Memorial Hospital and collaborates with UBC.

Her journey into medicine was inspired by her early experiences in French Guinea, Africa, where she witnessed significant disparities in women's health — a passion that continues to drive her practice today.
