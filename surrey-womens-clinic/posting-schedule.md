# Surrey Women's Clinic — 4-Week Instagram Posting Schedule

## Posting Strategy

### Optimal Posting Times for Surrey/Vancouver, BC (PST)

Based on Instagram engagement research for health/wellness accounts in the Canadian Pacific timezone:

| Day | Best Time (PST) | Why |
|-----|-----------------|-----|
| **Tuesday** | 11:00 AM | Mid-morning engagement peak, workday browsing |
| **Wednesday** | 12:00 PM | Lunch break scrolling, highest midweek engagement |
| **Thursday** | 11:00 AM | Strong engagement day for health content |
| **Friday** | 10:00 AM | Weekend planning mode, self-care mindset |
| **Saturday** | 10:00 AM | Relaxed morning browsing, highest weekend reach |

### Why These Times?
- **11 AM – 1 PM PST** is the sweet spot for BC-based health/wellness accounts
- Surrey/Vancouver audiences are most active during lunch breaks (Tue–Thu)
- Saturday mornings capture the "self-care weekend" mindset
- Avoid Sundays (lowest engagement) and Mondays (return-to-work mode)
- Health/wellness content performs best when audiences are in a reflective, self-care mindset

### Content Mix Strategy
- **Educational:** 7 posts (35%) — treatment explainers, facts, FAQs
- **Testimonial:** 3 posts (15%) — real patient stories
- **Myth-Busting:** 3 posts (15%) — breaking stigma and misinformation
- **Lifestyle/Empowerment:** 4 posts (20%) — inspiration, Dr. B's story

## Engagement Tips

### Best Practices for Each Post
1. **Respond to ALL comments** within 2 hours of posting
2. **Use Instagram Stories** to tease each post before it goes live
3. **Add to Highlights:** Create highlight categories — "Treatments," "Testimonials," "FAQs," "About Dr. B"
4. **Cross-post Reels** to Facebook for additional reach
5. **Pin top 3 posts** — Recommend pinning Posts 1, 3, and 18

### Hashtag Strategy
- **Always include:** #SurreyWomensClinic #SurreyBC #WomensHealth
- **Rotate local tags:** #VancouverHealth #BCWomensHealth #SurreyDoctor #WhiteRock #CrescentBeach
- **Use 15–20 hashtags per post** (mix of broad + niche)
- **Add to first comment** (not caption) for cleaner appearance — optional

### Stories Companion Plan
Post a complementary Story on each posting day:
- **Poll:** "Did you know about this treatment? Yes / Tell me more!"
- **Question box:** "What questions do you have about pelvic floor health?"
- **Countdown:** For any special promotions
- **Share to Story:** When posting testimonials, add "This is why we do what we do 💛"
