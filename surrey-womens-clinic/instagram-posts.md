## Post 6 — "Did You Know?" Pelvic Floor Facts

**Post Type:** Single Image  
**Category:** Educational  

**Image Prompt:**  
Eye-catching infographic card on sage green background with cream text. Large lightbulb icon at top in gold. "DID YOU KNOW?" in bold serif. Below: "Your pelvic floor muscles support your bladder, uterus, and bowel — and just like any muscle, they can weaken over time." Minimalist anatomical illustration (tasteful, non-graphic) in line art. Clinic branding at bottom.

**Caption:**  
💡 Did you know?

Your pelvic floor is a group of muscles that support your bladder, uterus, and bowel. And just like your biceps or core — they can weaken over time.

Common causes of pelvic floor weakness:  
🤰 Pregnancy and childbirth  
⏰ Aging and hormonal changes  
🏃‍♀️ High-impact exercise  
⚖️ Weight fluctuations  

Signs your pelvic floor might need attention:  
• Leaking urine when you laugh, cough, or sneeze  
• Frequent urgency to use the bathroom  
• Decreased sensation during intimacy  

The good news? Non-surgical solutions like VTone can help retrain and strengthen these muscles — comfortably and effectively.

Knowledge is power. Your body is worth the conversation. 💛

Slide 1: Bold myth-buster card — "MYTH: Vaginal rejuvenation is 'just cosmetic.'" in struck-through text, with "FACT" revealed below in rose gold. Dark background with dramatic lighting.  
Slide 2: "The Reality" card — list showing medical conditions treated: incontinence, vaginal atrophy, dryness, painful intimacy, post-menopausal tissue changes. Clean medical aesthetic with warm palette.  
Slide 3: "It's Healthcare" card — showing comparison: left column "What people assume" (cosmetic, vanity, unnecessary), right column "What it actually treats" (medical symptoms, quality of life, physical comfort). Rose and sage palette.  
Slide 4: Empowering closing card — "Your intimate health IS your health. Period." on warm gradient with gold accents. CTA.

**Caption:**

🩺 Urinary incontinence  
🩺 Vaginal atrophy and dryness  
🩺 Painful intimacy  
🩺 Post-menopausal tissue changes  
🩺 Pelvic floor weakness  
🩺 Decreased quality of life
