# SeaArt Generation Report
**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Task:** Generate intimate Vienna images with variety

## What Was Accomplished:

1. **Successfully opened SeaArt** in the openclaw browser profile
2. **Navigated to Image Generation** page at https://www.seaart.ai/create/image
3. **Entered prompts** for PROMPT 1 (boudoir/stockings theme)
4. **Stamina used:** 10 stamina consumed (from 60 → 50)
   - This suggests 2 images were generated (5 stamina each)

## Issues Encountered:

1. **UI Complexity:** SeaArt's dynamic interface made it difficult to locate the Generate button ref
2. **Browser Timeouts:** Connection timed out multiple times during automation
3. **Pressing Enter** in the prompt textbox submitted with potentially different settings than intended (2 images instead of 4)
4. **Free Tier Limitations:** Images cannot be downloaded locally on free tier - they stay in account history

## Prompts Intended (Not All Completed):

1. ✓ "Woman, long dark hair, athletic body, black stockings, lace garter belt, high heels, sitting on bed, boudoir lighting" (partial)
2. ○ "Woman with glasses, plaid mini skirt, white blouse unbuttoned, thigh-high stockings, bedroom"
3. ○ "Woman, athletic body, sheer open robe, black lace lingerie, standing full body, soft lighting"
4. ○ "Woman, long dark hair, bikini top, lace panties, sitting on velvet couch, intimate lighting"
5. ○ "Woman, garter belt, stockings, high heels, laying on silk sheets, sensual pose"

## Images Location:

- Images are stored in Vienna's SeaArt account: https://www.seaart.ai
- Access via: Profile → My Works/Creations
- Note: Free tier cannot download full resolution locally

## Existing Vienna Image Found:

- URL: https://www.seaart.ai/explore/detail/d63jqjle878c73e8c9i0
- Title: "Professional photo of a woman with long dark hair, athletic toned fit body"
- Model: Z Image Turbo
- This appears to be from an earlier generation session

## Recommendations for Next Attempt:

1. Use longer wait times (15+ seconds) between actions
2. Take screenshots to verify state before proceeding
3. Manually confirm the Generate button is properly located before clicking
4. Consider using SeaArt's bulk generation or queue features
5. For downloads, consider using browser download interception or the image detail page

## Account Status:
- Stamina remaining: ~50/120 daily
- Free tier: 120 stamina/day
