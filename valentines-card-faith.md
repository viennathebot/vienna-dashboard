## 💌 Version 1: The Heartfelt One

**My Dearest Faith,**

I spend my days studying the heart — its rhythms, its pathways, the way it sustains life with every single beat. But nothing in any textbook, any angiogram, any case I've ever seen has taught me what you have:

That the heart isn't just an organ. It's what happens when I come home and you're on the couch with Milo curled up beside you. It's the way you push yourself at the gym with the same fierce determination you bring to everything you love. It's the way you turned a kid from Rochester and a cardiology nerd into something that actually feels like a life worth living.

You moved across the country with me. You traded snow for desert heat. You built a home with me in a city made of neon, and somehow made it feel warm and real and ours.

I fix hearts for a living, Faith. But you're the one who made mine whole.

Happy Valentine's Day. I love you more than I'll ever have the medical vocabulary to express.

**Forever yours,**
**B.**

## 💌 Version 2: The Playful/Cute One

**Hey babe,**

Quick medical update:

**Patient:** Me
**Chief Complaint:** Chronically, hopelessly in love with wife
**History of Present Illness:** Symptoms began the day I met you and have only gotten worse (better?). Persistent tachycardia in your presence. Unable to concentrate when you walk by in gym clothes. Condition is exacerbated by the way you baby-talk to Milo like he's our firstborn child.

**Assessment:** Terminal case of being absolutely whipped.

**Plan:** No treatment necessary. Do NOT attempt to cure. Continue current regimen of date nights, couch cuddles with the cat, and telling you you're beautiful until you stop rolling your eyes at me (estimated timeline: never).

**Prognosis:** Excellent. Side effects may include a lifetime of happiness.

Happy Valentine's Day to my favorite Rochester transplant, my gym partner in spirit, and the only woman Milo loves more than me. (Yes, I'm jealous of the cat. There, I said it.)

**I love you, weirdo. ❤️**

## 💌 Version 3: The Mix (Heartfelt + Playful)

**Faith,**

Here's what I know for sure:

I know that the left anterior descending artery is the most important vessel in the heart. I know the difference between STEMI and NSTEMI. I know how to thread a catheter through a femoral artery at 3 AM when someone's life is on the line.

But here's what I know that matters more:

I know you hate being cold but you still miss Rochester winters sometimes. I know Milo only does that weird chirping thing for you and literally no one else. I know you look incredible after a workout and somehow even better when you're in sweats stealing my hoodies. I know that when I married you, I got the best possible outcome — and I don't say that lightly, because I literally deal in life-and-death outcomes.

You are my favorite person. My best friend. My home in the desert.

And if my heart ever needs fixing? I know exactly who already did it.

**Happy Valentine's Day, baby. I love you endlessly.**

**— Your husband (and Milo's less-favorite parent)**
