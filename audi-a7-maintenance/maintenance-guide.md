### Tools Needed

- 19mm hex socket (for drain plug)
- 32mm socket or oil filter cap wrench
- Oil drain pan (8+ quart capacity)
- Funnel
- Torque wrench
- Paper towels / rags
- Floor jack + stands (or ramps)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Preparation
1. **Warm up the engine** for 3–5 minutes. Warm oil drains faster and carries more contaminants.
2. **Raise the vehicle** using a floor jack and secure on jack stands (see Section 7 for jack points). Alternatively, use low-profile ramps.
3. Place the oil drain pan under the engine.

#### Drain the Oil
4. **Remove the undertray** (belly pan) — there are multiple T25 Torx screws and plastic clips holding the engine undertray. Some A7s have an access panel you can open without removing the whole tray.
5. **Locate the drain plug** on the oil pan — it's at the bottom-rear of the engine. It takes a **19mm hex (Allen) key/socket**.
6. **Remove the drain plug** by turning counterclockwise. Be ready — oil will come out fast and hot.
7. **Let it drain completely** — at least 10–15 minutes. Go work on the filter while you wait.

#### Replace the Oil Filter
8. **Locate the oil filter housing** — it's on the **top-front of the engine**, passenger side. You can access it from the engine bay (no need to go underneath).
9. **Remove the oil filter cap** using a **32mm socket** or the correct oil filter cap wrench. Turn counterclockwise.
10. **Pull the old filter element** straight up out of the housing.
11. **Replace the O-ring** on the filter cap with the new one included with the Mann HU 8001 filter kit.
12. **Install the new filter element** into the housing — push it down firmly until it seats.
13. **Reinstall the filter cap** — hand-tight first, then torque to **25 Nm (18 ft-lbs)**.

#### Reinstall Drain Plug & Fill
14. **Install a new crush washer** on the drain plug (always replace).
15. **Reinstall the drain plug** — torque to **30 Nm (22 ft-lbs)**.
16. **Reinstall the undertray** if removed.
17. **Lower the vehicle**.
18. **Fill with oil** — pour in **6.5 quarts** first through the oil filler cap on top of the engine.
19. **Check the dipstick** (electronic on this car — use the MMI display: CAR → Servicing → Oil Level).
20. **Start the engine** and let it idle for 1–2 minutes. Check for leaks underneath.
21. **Shut off** and wait 5 minutes, then re-check the oil level. Top off if needed up to 6.9 quarts.

#### Reset the Service Reminder
22. Turn ignition on (don't start).
23. Go to **CAR → Servicing & Checks → Reset** in the MMI.
24. Confirm the oil change service reset.

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings
- Never work under a car supported only by a jack — always use jack stands.
- Hot oil can cause burns — wear gloves and be careful when removing the drain plug.
- Properly dispose of old oil at any auto parts store (free).

### 💡 Tips
- Buy oil in the 5-quart jug + 2 extra quarts. This engine takes nearly 7 quarts.
- The Mann HU 8001 is the OEM supplier filter — it's identical to what Audi dealers install.
- If you have trouble with the 19mm hex drain plug, make sure you're using a hex (Allen) socket, NOT a standard 6-point socket.
- Consider buying a Fumoto oil drain valve to eliminate drain plug hassle on future changes.

## 2. Tire Rotation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐ (2/5) |
| **Time** | 30–45 minutes |
| **Interval** | Every 5,000–7,500 miles |
| **Pattern** | X-Pattern (cross rotation) for AWD with non-staggered tires |

### ⚠️ Current Status: OVERDUE

Your Michelin Pilot Sport AS4 tires were purchased **April 2024** and have **never been rotated**. If you've driven 10,000+ miles since then, you likely have uneven wear. Rotate ASAP.

### Why Rotate on an AWD Quattro?

- AWD systems distribute power to all four wheels — uneven tire wear causes the system to work harder
- Mismatched tire diameters (from uneven wear) can damage the Torsen center differential
- Even wear extends tire life by 20–30%
- Your tires are NOT staggered (same 255/40ZR19 all around) — rotation is possible and recommended

### Rotation Pattern: X-Pattern (AWD Recommended)

```
FRONT                    FRONT
 LF    RF                RF    LF
  \   /                  ↑     ↑
   \ /        →          |     |
   / \                   |     |
  /   \                  ↓     ↓
 LR    RR               LR    RR
REAR                    REAR

Left Front  → Right Rear
Right Front → Left Rear
Left Rear   → Right Front
Right Rear  → Left Front
```

**Alternative:** Forward cross pattern is also acceptable:
- Rear tires move straight to the front (same side)
- Front tires cross to the opposite rear

### Tools Needed

- Floor jack (see Section 7)
- 4 jack stands (see Section 7)
- 17mm lug bolt socket (the A7 uses lug bolts, not lug nuts)
- Torque wrench (lug bolt torque: **120 Nm / 89 ft-lbs**)
- Breaker bar (for loosening)
- Wheel chocks
- Chalk or tape for marking tires

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Preparation
1. Park on a **flat, level surface** (garage is ideal).
2. **Mark each tire** with chalk: LF, RF, LR, RR so you know where each started.
3. **Loosen ALL lug bolts** slightly (1/4 turn) while all four tires are still on the ground. This is critical — don't try to loosen them in the air.

#### Lift the Car
4. Using the floor jack, **lift the front of the car** first using the front jack point (see Section 7).
5. **Place jack stands** under both front reinforced jack points.
6. **Lower the car onto the front jack stands**.
7. Repeat: **lift the rear** and place jack stands under both rear jack points.
8. **Confirm the car is stable** on all four stands — give it a firm push to test.

#### Rotate the Tires
9. **Remove all four wheels** — the A7 uses lug bolts that thread INTO the hub (not lug nuts on studs). Be ready to hold the wheel as you remove the last bolt.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Thread in an alignment pin/guide bolt (or just leave one bolt finger-tight) to hold the wheel while removing/installing the others. You can buy Audi wheel alignment pins cheaply on Amazon.

10. Following the **X-pattern**, move each wheel to its new position:
    - Left Front → Right Rear
    - Right Front → Left Rear  
    - Left Rear → Right Front
    - Right Rear → Left Front

11. **Hand-thread all lug bolts** first to avoid cross-threading. The A7 takes **5 lug bolts per wheel**.
12. **Tighten in a star pattern** — don't tighten them in a circle. This ensures even seating.
13. **Lower the car** off the jack stands.
14. **Final torque** all lug bolts to **120 Nm (89 ft-lbs)** in a star pattern with the car on the ground.

#### Post-Rotation
15. **Check tire pressures** — set all four to **36 PSI** (cold) per the door jamb sticker for 19" wheels.
16. **Reset the TPMS** if needed through the MMI: CAR → Tire Pressure → Store Tire Pressures.
17. **Re-torque** the lug bolts after 50–100 miles of driving.

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings
- ALWAYS use jack stands — never rely on the jack alone
- The A7 uses lug bolts, NOT lug nuts — the wheel hangs freely when all bolts are out. Hold it!
- Set the parking brake and use wheel chocks when lifting

### 💡 Tips
- Buy a set of Audi wheel alignment guide pins (~$10 on Amazon) — they make wheel installation 10x easier since you don't have to hold the wheel while threading bolts
- If you notice significant uneven wear after this first rotation, consider an alignment check
- Don't forget to check your TPMS system after rotation

## 3. Cabin Air Filter Replacement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐ (1/5) — Easiest job on this list |
| **Time** | 10–15 minutes |
| **Interval** | Every 15,000–20,000 miles or once per year |
| **Filter Type** | Activated carbon (charcoal) — filters particles AND odors |

### Parts Needed

| Part | OE Number | Recommended | Amazon Search |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Cabin Air Filter | 4H0 819 439 | Mann CUK 2641 (activated carbon) | [Search Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mann+CUK+2641+cabin+air+filter+Audi+A7) |

| Budget Option | — | KAX CF11436 (activated carbon) | [Search Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=KAX+CF11436+cabin+air+filter+Audi+A7) |

### Tools Needed

- T20 Torx screwdriver (that's it!)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the passenger door** and clear the footwell area.
2. **Locate the cabin filter cover** — it's behind the lower dashboard panel on the **passenger side**, near the center console area (left side of the footwell when sitting in the passenger seat).
3. **Remove the footwell trim panel** — there are 2–3 **T20 Torx screws** holding the lower kick panel. Remove them and pull the panel down/away.
4. **Find the cabin filter housing** — you'll see a rectangular cover with a tab/latch.
5. **Release the cover tab** and slide/pull the cover out.
6. **Slide the old filter out** — note which direction the airflow arrow points (usually down or toward the rear). Take a photo for reference.
7. **Inspect the old filter** — it'll likely be grey/black with debris. Satisfying to see how much junk it caught!
8. **Install the new filter** — make sure the **airflow arrow matches** the direction marked on the housing. Mann filters have a clear arrow printed on the side.
9. **Reinstall the cover** and snap it into place.
10. **Reinstall the kick panel** with the T20 Torx screws.
11. **Test the HVAC** — turn the fan on high and make sure air flows properly.

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings
- None — this is a completely safe, tool-minimal job
- If you have allergies, consider wearing a mask when removing the old filter (it's full of dust/pollen)

### 💡 Tips
- The Mann CUK 2641 is the OEM supplier — same filter Audi dealers install but at 1/3 the price
- Replace annually or whenever you notice reduced HVAC airflow or musty smells
- The activated carbon version filters odors (exhaust fumes, etc.) — worth the extra $3–5
- Consider the Mann FreciousPlus (FP 2641) for allergy protection — it has an antibacterial layer

### Tools Needed

- T25 Torx screwdriver
- That's it!

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the hood** and prop it up.
2. **Locate the air filter box** — it's the large black plastic box on the **driver's side** (left side) of the engine bay, connected to the intake hose.
3. **Release the clips/screws** — the air filter box lid is secured by either spring clips or **T25 Torx screws** (varies by specific production date). Undo them.
4. **Lift the air filter box lid** — you may need to gently pull it up and disconnect the intake tube. Don't force it.
5. **Remove the old filter** — pull it straight up out of the lower housing.
6. **Clean the housing** — use a clean rag or shop vacuum to remove any debris/leaves from inside the filter box. Don't let anything fall into the intake.
7. **Install the new filter** — set it into the lower housing. Make sure it seats evenly all the way around.
8. **Reinstall the air filter box lid** — push it down firmly and re-secure the clips or Torx screws.
9. **Reconnect the intake tube** if disconnected.
10. **Double-check** that everything is secure and no hoses are disconnected.

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings
- Make sure the engine is **off and cool** before working in the engine bay
- Don't drop anything into the open intake — it'll get sucked into the engine

### 💡 Tips
- Hold the old and new filters up to light — if you can't see light through the old one, it was definitely time
- The K&N E-1983 is washable and reusable — more expensive upfront but lasts the life of the car. Just clean and re-oil it every 30K miles
- The Mann C 16 005 is the OEM supplier filter — identical to what Audi installs
- This is the easiest job on the entire car — great first DIY project

## 5. Spark Plug Replacement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) — More involved due to supercharger/intake placement |
| **Time** | 2–3 hours (first time), 1.5 hours once familiar |
| **Interval** | Every 40,000–60,000 miles |
| **Spark Plug** | NGK 94460 (ILZKR7B11) — Laser Iridium |
| **Quantity** | 6 (V6 engine) |
| **Gap** | Pre-gapped from factory (0.036" / 0.9mm) — do NOT regap |
| **Torque** | 25 Nm (18 ft-lbs) |

### Why This Is Harder on the A7 3.0T

The Audi 3.0T supercharged engine has the supercharger and intake manifold sitting **on top** of the engine, directly above the spark plugs. On the front bank (passenger side, cylinders 1-3), you can access the plugs relatively easily by removing the engine cover and some intake components. The rear bank (driver side, cylinders 4-6) is much harder — the spark plugs are buried under the supercharger/intake manifold.

**The supercharger/intake manifold does NOT need to be fully removed**, but you'll need to remove the engine beauty cover, throttle body area, and some intake components to reach the rear bank.

| Anti-Seize | — | Permatex Anti-Seize (optional but recommended) | [Search Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Permatex+anti-seize+spark+plug) |

### Tools Needed

- 5/8" (16mm) spark plug socket with rubber insert (thin-wall)
- 3/8" ratchet with extensions (6" and 10")
- Universal joint (swivel) for the socket
- T30, T25 Torx bits
- 10mm socket
- Torque wrench (reading in Nm)
- Magnetic pickup tool (for dropped bolts)
- Compressed air or shop vac (to clean spark plug wells)
- Anti-seize compound
- Dielectric grease (for coil pack boots)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Front Bank (Cylinders 1-3 — Passenger Side) — Easier

1. **Remove the engine beauty cover** — pull straight up on each corner (held by rubber grommets).
2. **Disconnect the three ignition coil connectors** on the front bank — push the tab and pull the connector off each coil.
3. **Remove the coil pack bolts** — one **T30 Torx bolt** per coil.
4. **Pull each coil pack straight up** — twist slightly and pull. They can be stuck due to heat.
5. **Blow out the spark plug wells** with compressed air — you don't want debris falling into the cylinder when you remove the plug.
6. **Insert the spark plug socket** with extension into the well.
7. **Loosen and remove each spark plug** — turn counterclockwise. They'll be tight.
8. **Inspect the old plugs** — check for oil, carbon, damage. Normal wear shows a light tan electrode.
9. **Apply a tiny dab of anti-seize** to the new plug threads (optional — some mechanics skip this on NGK iridiums).
10. **Install the new plug by hand first** — thread it in by hand (or using a piece of rubber hose over the plug to turn it) to avoid cross-threading. THIS IS CRITICAL.
11. **Torque to 25 Nm (18 ft-lbs)** — do NOT overtighten. Aluminum heads strip easily.
12. **Apply a thin coat of dielectric grease** inside the coil pack boot.
13. **Reinstall coil packs** — push firmly until they click/seat.
14. **Reinstall coil pack bolts** and reconnect the electrical connectors.

#### Rear Bank (Cylinders 4-6 — Driver Side) — Harder

15. **Remove additional intake components** to access the rear bank. This typically involves:
    - Removing the air intake duct/hose
    - Unbolting/moving coolant lines or brackets as needed
    - On some A7s, removing the throttle body assembly or upper intake manifold support brackets
16. **Disconnect the three rear ignition coil connectors** — they're deeper and harder to reach.
17. **Remove the rear coil pack bolts** (T30 Torx) — use extensions and a universal joint.
18. **Pull each rear coil pack out** — these are harder to grip. Long-nose pliers on the boot can help.
19. **Blow out the spark plug wells** — even more important here since debris can accumulate.
20. **Remove and replace each spark plug** following the same procedure as the front bank (steps 6–13).
21. **Reinstall all rear coil packs, bolts, and connectors**.
22. **Reinstall all intake components** you removed.
23. **Reinstall the engine beauty cover**.

#### Verify
24. **Start the engine** — it should start smoothly with no misfires.
25. **Check for any codes** — if you have an OBD2 scanner, verify no fault codes.
26. **Test drive** — accelerate smoothly through the RPM range. Any hesitation or misfire means a plug may not be seated or a coil isn't connected.

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings
- **Let the engine cool completely** (2+ hours) before touching spark plugs — removing plugs from a hot aluminum head can strip the threads
- **Always thread by hand first** — cross-threading a spark plug into an aluminum head is a very expensive mistake
- **Don't overtighten** — 25 Nm max. Stripped threads require a helicoil repair ($$$)
- **Don't drop anything into open spark plug wells** — use a magnetic pickup tool

### 💡 Tips
- Buy a spark plug socket with a **rubber insert** (grips the plug) and use **thin-wall** — the wells on the 3.0T are narrow
- Take photos at every step so you remember where everything goes for reassembly
- Label connectors and bolts in ziplock bags
- The NGK 94460 (ILZKR7B11) is the OE-spec plug — don't use cheap alternatives on a supercharged engine
- If you've never done spark plugs on a modern German engine before, watch a YouTube walkthrough first. Search: "Audi 3.0T supercharged spark plug replacement DIY"
- Consider doing ignition coils at the same time if they have 80K+ miles — you're already in there

## 6. Brake Wear Sensor Replacement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐ (2/5) |
| **Time** | 20–30 minutes per axle |
| **Interval** | Replace whenever you replace brake pads — sensors are single-use |

### How Brake Wear Sensors Work

The 2015 A7 has electronic brake wear sensors on the **front left** and **rear right** wheels (one per axle, on opposite sides). When the brake pad wears down to the sensor wire, the wire breaks, triggering a warning on the dash: **"Brake pad wear — visit workshop."**

Sensors are **single-use** — once triggered, they must be replaced along with the pads. Even if not triggered, replace them with every pad change as preventive maintenance.

### Parts Needed

| Set (Front + Rear) | Both | — | Bapmic or A-Premium Set | [Search Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=2015+Audi+A7+brake+wear+sensor+set+front+rear) |

### Tools Needed

- Floor jack + jack stands
- 17mm socket (for wheel bolts)
- Needle-nose pliers
- Flathead screwdriver (for clip removal)
- No special tools needed

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Front Brake Wear Sensor (Front Left Wheel)

1. **Raise the front left of the car** and secure on a jack stand.
2. **Remove the front left wheel** (5 lug bolts, 17mm).
3. **Locate the sensor wire** — it runs from the brake caliper area along the suspension, up into the wheel well, and connects to a plug in the engine bay / inner fender.
4. **Follow the wire to the electrical connector** — it's usually clipped to the inner fender liner or brake line bracket. Disconnect the electrical plug.
5. **Release the wire from any routing clips** along the suspension/brake line — note where each clip is for reinstallation.
6. **Pull the sensor probe out of the brake pad** — it's pressed into a hole in the inboard brake pad. Gently pull it straight out.
7. **Install the new sensor** — push the probe firmly into the brake pad hole until it clicks/seats.
8. **Route the new wire** following the same path as the old one, securing it in all the same clips.
9. **Connect the electrical plug** — push until it clicks.
10. **Reinstall the wheel** and torque lug bolts to **120 Nm (89 ft-lbs)**.

#### Rear Brake Wear Sensor (Rear Right Wheel)

11. Repeat the same process on the **rear right wheel**.
12. The rear sensor wire is typically shorter and easier to access.

#### Reset the Warning
13. The brake pad warning on the dash should clear automatically after the new sensor is connected and you drive for a few minutes.
14. If it doesn't clear, use an OBD2 scanner (VCDS/OBDeleven) to clear the fault code.

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings
- Always use jack stands — never work under a car supported only by a jack
- Don't stretch or kink the sensor wire — it's thin and fragile

### 💡 Tips
- Sensors are cheap ($8–15 each) — always replace them with brake pads, even if the old ones haven't triggered
- If your dash shows a brake wear warning and the pads look OK, the sensor wire probably just broke or corroded — replace it
- Take a photo of the wire routing before removal
- Some aftermarket pads come with new sensors included — check before buying separately

## 7. Jack & Lift Setup

| | |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | ⭐ (1/5) — Just buying and learning |
| **Priority** | 🔴 **BUY FIRST** — you need this for every other job |
| **Total Cost** | ~$200–350 for a complete setup |

### What You Need to Buy

#### 1. Floor Jack — Low Profile is ESSENTIAL

The A7 sits very low to the ground. A standard floor jack won't fit underneath. You **must** get a low-profile jack.

| Recommendation | Details | Amazon Search |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| **Pittsburgh 2-Ton Low Profile Jack** (Harbor Freight) | Low-profile entry height ~3.5", lifts to 14". Best value. | [Search Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=2+ton+low+profile+floor+jack+aluminum) |
| **Arcan ALJ2T 2-Ton Aluminum Jack** (Upgrade Pick) | Professional quality, 3.3" min height, lightweight aluminum. ~$100. | [Search Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Arcan+ALJ2T+2+ton+aluminum+floor+jack) |

### 2015 Audi A7 Jack Points

The A7 (C7 platform) has specific reinforced points designed for lifting. **Using the wrong points can crush body panels or damage the unibody.**

#### For a Floor Jack (Lifting Points):

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
          FRONT OF CAR

  On the reinforced pinch weld (rocker panel)
  behind the front wheel, about 6-8" back.
  Look for the notch/flat spot in the pinch weld.
  
  USE A JACK PAD ADAPTER to protect the 
  pinch weld!

  Look for the notch/flat spot in the pinch weld.

═══════════════════════════════════════

    ⬆️ REAR CENTER LIFT POINT
    Located on the rear subframe/differential mount.
    Use this to lift the entire rear axle.

#### Important Jack Point Rules:

1. **NEVER jack on the oil pan, transmission, or body panels** — you will cause expensive damage
2. **Always use a rubber jack pad adapter** on the pinch welds — bare metal jacks will crush/dent the weld
3. **The center front point** is on the front subframe crossmember — look for a flat reinforced area
4. **The center rear point** is on the rear subframe near the differential
5. **Individual jack stand points** are on the reinforced pinch welds — look for the flat notches

### First-Time Setup Procedure

1. **Find your workspace** — flat, level concrete (garage floor is ideal)
2. **Set the parking brake** firmly
3. **Place wheel chocks** behind the rear tires (if lifting front) or in front of the front tires (if lifting rear)
4. **Position the floor jack** under the center front or center rear lift point
5. **Pump the jack slowly** — watch that it's contacting the right spot
6. **Place jack stands** at the reinforced pinch weld points as soon as there's enough clearance
7. **Slowly lower the car onto the jack stands** — do NOT yank the release
8. **Give the car a firm push** from the side to confirm stability before going underneath

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings — READ THIS

- **NEVER work under a car supported only by a floor jack** — jacks can fail, hydraulic seals can blow. A falling car WILL kill you.
- **Always use jack stands** — this is non-negotiable
- **Work on flat, level concrete only** — never on grass, gravel, or slopes
- **Set the parking brake and use wheel chocks** every time
- **Don't lift from the side pinch welds with the floor jack** unless you have a proper pad — they're thin and will crush
- **The A7 is LOW** — you may need to drive up on thin boards (1" plywood) first to get the jack underneath

### 💡 Tips
- The rubber jack pad adapters are $10–15 on Amazon and save hundreds in body damage — **buy them**
- Keep a pair of heavy leather gloves with your jack — you'll be handling sharp/dirty metal
- For oil changes only, consider **Rhino Ramps** (~$40) instead of jacking — drive up, done. But you still need jack/stands for tire rotations and brake work
- Practice jacking the car up in your garage on a weekend with no pressure — don't learn on the day you need it
- A folding creeper (~$30 on Amazon) makes under-car work much more comfortable
